What is EXACT?
==============

EXACT is a program that implements "POP Before SMTP Relay Authentication".  

It will work as is with Exim_, and configuration instructions are provided in
this file.  I also believe it will work with Sendmail_ and Postfix_ without
problems, however I haven't tried these yet.  If you get this working, please
send_ me your working configurations so I can include them here.

It doesn't support qmail_ as-is, because qmail would require an additional
program to configure the environment for it.  I plan to support this at some
point - again, if you get this working please send_ me your software.  See below
for some other software that might help though.

What is "POP Before SMTP Relay Authentication"?
===============================================

POP Before SMTP Relay Authentication is commonly used on systems that provide
both IMAP or POP services and SMTP services.  If you have users who move from
system to system, and access their mail over IMAP or POP, it is a fair bet that
they will also want to send mail.  

If your users are using Windows they probably don't have a locally installed
mail relay, so they have to use someone elses.  Also, some (broken) sites refuse
email from dialup systems on the grounds that the email might be spam.

Generally you should send mail through your network providers local SMTP
servers.  However, sometimes it's not obvious what those servers are (at least
to your users), and sometimes these servers provide poor service and so you wish
to avoid them.

Therefore, you would like to provide an SMTP relay for those users only.  SMTP
Authentication is an option, however not all clients provide it and, more
irritatingly, on PAM-based systems authenticating against the shadow file is
impossible for non root processes.  Well, I couldn't get it to work anyway.

So a simple hack is often used - to selectively allow SMTP relaying for IP
addresses that have recently authenticated against a local IMAP or POP server.

How does it work?
=================

When started, the program watches a log file for lines written by a POP or IMAP
server that indicate a successful login.  Generally this is a file written by
syslog, by default /var/log/mail.log.  On your system it may be different.

When one of these lines is seen, it is added to an internal database of
ip addresses and is also written out to a text file.  Periodically, old entries
are cleaned from this file.

Your MTA can then be configured to read this file, to determine hosts that are
allowed to relay.

What other software does this?
==============================

I couldn't find anything that suited my needs perfectly, which is why I wrote
this.  DRAC_ performs the same task, using patched IMAP and POP servers.  I
didn't like this approach and haven't tried it, however YMMV.

There are also some perl scripts_ available from some other guy called Doug_
available, that work with exim pretty easily (although they do require tweaking)
- I've not tried them with any other MTA.

For qmail, smtp-poplock_ works well.

How do I make it work with my MTA?
==================================

Exim 
----

This is very simple to implement in Exim.  Add a line like:

host_accept_relay = 127.0.0.1:lsearch;/var/state/exact/relay

where /var/state/exact/relay is the location of the relay file written by exact.

You may wish to add +allow_unknown as an option to this line, so it becomes:

host_accept_relay = +allow_unknown:127.0.0.1:lsearch;/var/state/exact/relay

However, I really don't recommend it.  It allows hosts to authenticate if they
are not in the reverse DNS.  This is obviously bad, because it could potentially
provide access to spammers.  Unfortunately the reverse DNS is woefully
incomplete, because many DNS administrators are incompetent or lazy and don't
maintain their reverse DNS.  This means the sites cannot be authenticated by
hostname, which is all that exim supports.

It would be really nice to be able to configure exim to authenticate based on IP
address, but I don't believe this is possible.  If I'm wrong, I'd love to know
how.

What's all the funny syntax in this file?
=========================================

If you are reading the text version of this file, you might have noticed some
odd syntax.  This file is written in reStructuredText.  This can be converted to
HTML (and other things) using docutils_.
