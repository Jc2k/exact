What is EXACT?
==============

EXACT is a program that implements "POP Before SMTP Relay Authentication".  

It will work as is with UW-IMAPD_, Cyrus_, Courier_ (IMAPD and POPD),
Perdition_, Qpopper_, Exim_ and Sendmail_. Configuration instructions are provided in
this file.  

I believe EXACT should work as-is with a number of other POP, IMAP and SMTP
implementations - and I'm happy to adapt the software to work with these if
necessary.  Please let me know if you get EXACT working with other
implementations, or if you think changes to EXACT are required.

If you get this working, please send_ me your working configurations so I can
include them here.

It doesn't support qmail_ as-is, because qmail is rather unique.  If you get
this working please send_ me your software, so I can include it, or include a
reference to it.  See below for some other software that might help though.

Why is it called EXACT?
=======================

EXACT stands for EXperimental Access Control Thing.  With apologies to Philip
Hazel.  As you may have guessed, marketing is not my strong suit.

What is "POP Before SMTP Relay Authentication"?
===============================================

POP Before SMTP Relay Authentication is commonly used on systems that provide
both IMAP or POP services and SMTP services.  If you have users who move from
system to system, and access their mail over IMAP or POP, it is a fair bet that
they will also want to send mail via your IMAP server.  

If your users are using Windows they probably don't have a locally installed
mail relay, so they have to use someone elses.  Also, some (broken) sites refuse
email from dialup systems on the grounds that the email might be spam.

Generally you should send mail through your network providers local SMTP
servers.  However, sometimes it's not obvious what those servers are (at least
to your users), and sometimes these servers provide poor service and so you wish
to avoid them.

Therefore, you would like to provide an SMTP relay for those users only.  SMTP
Authentication is an option, however not all clients provide it and, more
irritatingly, on PAM-based systems authenticating against the shadow file is
impossible for non root processes.  Well, I couldn't get it to work anyway.

So a simple hack is often used - to selectively allow SMTP relaying for IP
addresses that have recently authenticated against a local IMAP or POP server.

How does it work?
=================

When started, the program watches a log file for lines written by a POP or IMAP
server that indicate a successful login.  Generally this is a file written by
syslog, by default /var/log/mail.log.  On your system it may be different.

When one of these lines is seen, it is added to an internal database of
ip addresses and is also written out to a text file.  Periodically, old entries
are cleaned from this file.

Your MTA can then be configured to read this file, to determine hosts that are
allowed to relay.

Where can I get EXACT?
======================

The current version of EXACT is 1.35 and is available for download_.

.. _download: http://www.britishsteal.com/dist/exact/exact-1.35.tar.gz

There is also a `mailing list`_ for announcements.

What other software does this?
==============================

DRAC_ performs the same task, using patched IMAP and POP servers.  I didn't
like this approach and haven't tried it, however YMMV.

popbsmtp_ uses the same technique as EXACT, and is written in Perl.

There are also some perl scripts_ from some other guy called Doug_
available, that work with exim pretty easily (although they do require tweaking)
- I've not tried them with any other MTA.

For qmail, smtp-poplock_ works well.

How do I make it work with my POP/IMAP Server?
==============================================

Two parameters in the configuration file specify how lines are matched in the
POP/IMAP server log file, order and match.

The following stanzas are in the configuration file already, although some of
them are commented out.  Review and alter them as necessary.

UW-IMAPD
--------

The lines you need are::

    order           username,address
    match           (Login|Auth|Authenticated) user=([^ ]*).*\[([^ ]*)\]

Cyrus
-----

The lines you need are::

    order           address,username
    match           (login): \[([0-9\.]*)\] ([^ ]*)

Perdition
---------

The lines you need are::

    order           address,username
    match           (Auth): ([0-9\.]*)->.*user="([^"]*)"

Courier
-------

The lines you need are::

    order           username,address
    match           (LOGIN), user=(.*), ip=\[::ffff:(.*)\]

Qpopper
-------

The lines you need are::

    order           username,address
    match           (login) by user \"(.*)\" at \([^ ]*\) (.*) \[[^ ]*\]


How do I make it work with my MTA?
==================================

Exim 
----

This is very simple to implement in Exim.  Add a line like:

``host_accept_relay = 127.0.0.1:net-lsearch;/var/state/exact/relay``

where ``/var/state/exact/relay`` is the location of the relay file written by 
exact.  net-lsearch specifies that it will search that file for IP addresses.

You should be aware that when using exim, exact should be started first - if 
exim cannot find the state file when it starts then it will exit.

Sendmail
--------

Here's a tip from Johan Vansant describing how to make EXACT work with
Sendmail:

In order to have sendmail check an extra file you need to expand the rules.
Here is what I added to the 'mc' file, this can be added to the 'cf' file
directly if you leave out the 'LOCAL_CONFIG' and 'LOCAL_RULESETS' lines::

    LOCAL_CONFIG
    #POP Auth
    F{POPAuth} /usr/local/var/state/exact/relay
    
    SLocal_check_rcpt
    R<$+ @ $=w >            $@ OK # if it is to domain delivered by us
    R$+                     $: $(dequote "" $&{client_addr} $) $| $1 # get address
    R$={POPAuth}$* $| $*    $@ OK # OK if from a POP-authed address
    ROK                     $@ OK
    R$*                     $#error $@ 5.5.0 $: "550 Relaying denied: authenticate with POP first"

Thanks Johan :)

What's all the funny syntax in this file?
=========================================

If you are reading the text version of this file, you might have noticed some
odd syntax.  This file is written in reStructuredText.  This can be converted to
HTML (and other things) using docutils_.
