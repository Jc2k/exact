.TH "exact" 8
.SH NAME
exact \- smtp relay authentication based on previous pop or imap authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exact [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION

Often you may wish to allow selective SMTP relaying, based on a user having
previously authenticated against an IMAP or POP server.  Although this is a bit
of a kluge, it is popular because it provides simple configuration for users.

This daemon watches the logs produced by IMAP or POP files (by default
@ac_cv_watch) for lines indicating a user's successful authentication.  If a
user successfully authenticates, then their IP address is added to a list of
addresses from which relaying should be allowed.

This list is periodically cleaned of old entries.
