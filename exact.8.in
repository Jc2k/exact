.TH "exact" 8
.SH NAME
exact \- smtp relay authentication based on previous pop or imap authentication
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B exact [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION

Often you may wish to allow selecting SMTP relaying, based on a user having
previously authenticated against an IMAP or POP server.  Although this is a bit
of a kluge, it is popular because it provides simple configuration for users.

This daemon watches the logs produced by IMAP or POP files (by default @ac_cv_watch) 
for lines indicating
a user's successful authentication.  If a user successfully authenticates, then
their IP address is added to a list of addresses from which relaying should be
allowed.

This list is periodically cleaned of old entries.
