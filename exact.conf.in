## exact.conf -- EXACT daemon configuration file
##

#
# This configuration file specifies the various things needed by EXACT to
# function.
#


# 
# user: the username the EXACT daemon should run under.  It is strongly
# recommended that you run this in a mail group, or something similar, and allow
# access to the appropriate system logs to that group.  See the SECURITY
# document distributed with EXACT.
#
user			@ac_cv_user@

#
# group: the group the EXACT daemon should use.
#
group			@ac_cv_group@

#
# pidfile: the daemon will write it's process id to this file, to allow it to be
# controlled.
#
pidfile			@localstatedir@/run/exact/exact.pid

#
# maillog: this is the file the daemon watches.
#
maillog			@ac_cv_watch@

#
# serverdefs: the file containing definitions for known server types.
#
serverdefs      @sysconfdir@/exact-servers.conf

#
# server: the server to use, from the serverdefs file
#
server          @ac_cv_server@

#
# authtype: either 'db' or 'text'.  'db' is only valid if you have compiled 
# in berkeley database support (the --with-db switch to configure)
#
authtype        @ac_cv_authtype@

#
# authfile: the file the ip addresses to allow relay for are written to
#
authfile		@localstatedir@/state/exact/relay

#
# authtemp: a temporary file for writing the relay data to.  This is then moved
# to "authfile" atomically, to avoid race conditions.  This should be on the
# same filesystem as "authfile".
#
# this is only used by text type databases
#
authtemp		@localstatedir@/state/exact/relay.tmp

#
# dumpfile: if you send the exact process a SIGUSR1, it will dump it's state 
# table to this file
dumpfile		@localstatedir@/state/exact/dump

#
# timeout: the number of seconds before an ip address is removed from the relay
# file.
#
timeout			@timeout@

#
# flush: the period, in seconds, between flush cycles.  The daemon checks this
# often to see if ip addresses should be removed, if they are older than
# (timeout) seconds.
#
flush			@flush@

#
# suspicious: the time, in seconds, for which an unchanged logfile will trigger 
# a reopen.  this is designed to detect rotated logfiles.
#
suspicious		@suspicious@

#
# logging: either "syslog" or "internal".  defaults to syslog.  if "internal",
# then logs are written to the file specified by the "logfile" parameter.
logging			@logging@

#
# logfile: if logging is internal, the filename of the log file.
logfile			@localstatedir@/log/exact/exact.log
