EXACT 1.30

Added configuration option so it will work with Cyrus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.20

Fixed exact's behaviour when the watch file is missing - now, if the file is
missing, it will continue checking for the files existence until it reappears.
This seems to be the best way of handling this condition.

Fixed a problem on Solaris to do with discrepancies between POSIX standard
regular expression handling.  Some standard that is.  Now uses Extended regular
expressions, which seem to be more portable.  Thanks to Jeremy Zawodny for
reporting this.

Added some new functionality to support regression testing:
    
    * specify the configuration file on the command line
    * enable broken out logfile location, so regression logs don't
      go to syslog
    * moved all constants from exact.conf into the Makefile, so the regression
      configuration can have shorter timeouts easily

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.10

Amended it to use IP addresses in the relay file - this is better if you have
clients who have no reverse DNS.

Added usage information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.01

ipop3d uses "Auth" instead of "Authenticated" in it's log message.  Added this 
to the default configuration file.
