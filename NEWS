EXACT 1.34

added support for qpopper, supplied by Blair Harrison.

tidied the config file to make it more obvious how to enable a specific
MTA.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.33

changed mode of installed files, as per suggestion from Mike Whitaker.

committed patch from Mike Whitaker, specifying DESTDIR, for easier
debianization.

Added support for courier, patches from Mike Whitaker.

Solaris bug, patch from William Armitage:

    On Solaris (or any S5r4 derived UNIX) the fork in daemonize/dofork does not
    copy the primed Alarm timer from the parent process. hence auth_clean is
    never called.

Jon R. Luini spotted a bug in how the configure script worked on freebsd, this
has been fixed.

Upgraded the build system autoconf to 2.57, to avoid spurious errors on
freebsd.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.32

Fixed security hole in the uw-imapd regular expression, spotted by Jorey Bump.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.31

Added support for perdition.
Clarified the tail open debug message.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.30

Added configuration option so it will work with Cyrus.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.20

Fixed exact's behaviour when the watch file is missing - now, if the file is
missing, it will continue checking for the files existence until it reappears.
This seems to be the best way of handling this condition.

Fixed a problem on Solaris to do with discrepancies between POSIX standard
regular expression handling.  Some standard that is.  Now uses Extended regular
expressions, which seem to be more portable.  Thanks to Jeremy Zawodny for
reporting this.

Added some new functionality to support regression testing:
    
    * specify the configuration file on the command line
    * enable broken out logfile location, so regression logs don't
      go to syslog
    * moved all constants from exact.conf into the Makefile, so the regression
      configuration can have shorter timeouts easily

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.10

Amended it to use IP addresses in the relay file - this is better if you have
clients who have no reverse DNS.

Added usage information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.01

ipop3d uses "Auth" instead of "Authenticated" in it's log message.  Added this 
to the default configuration file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXACT 1.00

Initial Release
